# Greetings /r/Steam, I come bearing gifts!
 
I'm so excited to release the brand new theme for the subreddit, aiming to replicate the familiar look and feel of the steam website, I truly hope you all will enjoy it! 

The entire stylesheet has been remade from the ground up, lovingly crafted into the theme you see today. 

I'd like to highlight some of the more notable changes that have come with the new stylesheet:

## New Header

The new header on the subreddit will be used to showcase significant events for either Steam or Valve, most notably will be the various holiday sales. You should be able to see a lovely header complete with animated snow, and you may recognize the elf from Steam Winter Sale 2015 (or was it 2014? I don't recall myself).

Between major Steam events I would like to open the doors to community contributions, and assuming there are some nice submissions will rotate ocassionally through them.

**If you would like to contribute header images please send them through to me, [/u/dirtdiglett](https://www.reddit.com/user/DirtDiglett/) but note that the header image needs to be 3571 x 465 and have the left area clear so that the STEAM logo is unobstructed.**

## Reworked Flair System

We have a lot of flair on /r/steam, and with the new theme I sought to unify the flair system and steer it away from the chaotic mess it had become. You'll find that the flairs available to you have changed. They are all consistently sized, with multiple themes and game-specific flairs to choose from. I hope you will be happy with these choices, but of course we're open to suggestions for flairs you'd like to see on /r/steam.

** If you have any flair suggestions, please either send a modmail to the mod team or use the [Theme Feedback Survey](https://surveyhero.com/c/80f982f) that has been made by one of the newest members to our mod team - [R3TR1X](https://www.reddit.com/user/R3TR1X) **

The images have all been updated, they will be nicer visually, and your year badges will match the images used for the respective badges. Enjoy!

### Important note about your current flairs

With the massive changes that have occured, to both the stylesheet and the flair system, you'll find that all previously chosen flairs will either not be visible or be very broken. I ask that should this happen to you to please just select your flair from the sidebar again, and it will be back to being awesome.

The Source Filmmaker flair has been removed from the 'choose your own' flairs, and has moved to the 'special' flair group, and will be assigned by the Flair Assigner Bot.

### Flair Assigner Bot will currently not function (But has good changes incoming)

While we wait for the Flair Bot to be updated accordingly any flairs it assigns from the "Click for game and year badge flairs!" button will be broken.

On the positive side, when it has been updated it will now be able to assign you special "Steamworks Developer", "Steam Translator", "Steam Moderator" badges, should you be one of these.

## RES Support

[Alot](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com.au/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html) of work has gone into trying to ensure the theme supports as much of RES as reasonably possible. You'll hopefully find that there are no issues with RES whilst using the new theme. 

## There will be growing pains and potentially issues

Whilst the mod team and I have taken great lengths to test as much of the theme as possible on my testbed moving to production always has the opportunity to bring to light issues that were unseen previously. If you experience issues with the new theme please let me know either via a message, modmail, or the [Theme Feedback Survey](https://surveyhero.com/c/80f982f) and I'll do my best to resolve the problem as quickly as possible.

## Your Feedback

We're entering a a new era for the /r/steam moderating team, and as part of the changes happening we're really hoping to garner community feedback, not just about the new theme but about the subreddit in general, behaviours, interactions, opinions on our rules, etc. 

If you'd like to provide us with your feedback, thoughts, or opinions please use the new button you'll find to the left of the search bar and let us know - Or send us a modmail message via the "MESSAGE THE MODERATORS" button in the sidebar - We'd really appreciate it.


Thanks!
 
Have a great day!
