### Rules

1.   **Giveaways, Trading, Begging, and Coupon Threads** are not allowed.
2.   **No chat logs & phishing attempts.** We have all seen or had an interaction with a phishing attempt. We don't need to see the same thing continually.
3.   **No pricing Errors/Oddities/Steam Store bugs.** Glitches happen ("-999%"), Publishers think they're slick ("-1%"). Etc. 
4.   No **Steam Tags**.
5.   **No Steam Status notices after someone has already submitted them.** Check to see if someone has already mentioned Steam being down before posting.
6.   **Bandwidth/Download Speed Glitches:** Occasionally Steam will show an insanely high speed of download. Don't post it. It happens.
7.   No **rage comics, memes, "reaction"** images.
8.   No **Steam Wallet referral URLs**
9.   **No threads about issues with Steam:** See the Weekly Support Thread.
10.   **No images about friend requests from bots:** There's nothing we can do about it.
11. **No Steam Support ID's.** No Steam Support employees browse this subreddit, nor do they give precedence for members of our community.
12. Moderators can remove threads **at their own discretion**.
13. **No advertising Steam Groups.** 
14. **No Steam Reviews** - Report them through proper channels.
